# EXPERIMENT 1: Analysis of CS amplifier
## AIM:
### Demonstrating AC analysis,Transient analysis and DC analysis for CS Amplifier using LT spice software.Then finding Bandwidth,gain and etc,
## COMPONENTS REQUIRED:
### Resistor(1K ohm ),Mosfet(CMOSN,CMOSP),Voltage sources(1.8v,0.6v,0.3v),ground.
## THEORY:
### Mosfet is a elcetronic base component and we can say it as "fundamental and basic unit of Electronic components, which is neccesory to build IC circuit.
