EXPERIMENT:3 
DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER 
## AIM:design and analyze the MOS Differential Amplifier circuit for the following specifications.
## THEORY:
### Differential Amplifier is basically having two inputs and one output.this will amplify the difference between the two input signal ,so this will avoids or rejects the input values if it is come same, means it will rejects the common-mode signals . it is also the building blocks for the operational amplifiers.
###   Differential Amplifier is made up of mosfets only .so let us try to understant the what makes the difference between normal and differential amplifier. 
### 1.The normal and common amplifier has a single input but in case of differential amplifier we have two inputs
### 2.Output will depend on the input value incase of normal amplifier but in differential amplifier ouput is depends on the difference of input signal values.
### 3.Incase of differential amplifier we can see the noise rejection but incase of normal amplifiers it is absent.
### 4.The usage of this amplifiers make them different like Normal amplifiers are used in speakers,radios .But Differential amplifiers are used in operational amplifiers and sensors. so these will makes us difference between normal and differential amplifiers.
